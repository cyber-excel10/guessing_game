# Title of project:Guessing Game.
This is a simple number guessing game written in Rust. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.
The game provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low until the player guesses correctly.

#How This My Guessing Game Works.
* The game generates a secret number between 1 and 100.
* The player is prompted to enter their guess.
* The game will give feedback, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number.
* The player continues guessing until they get the correct number.
* After a correct guess,the game will display the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.

# Please Follow The Installation and Setup Process Below.
So the Requirements are:
* Before you can run the game, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. I Used Rust programming language to build the game. Follow these steps to install it (Rust Programming Language):
1.Visit the official Rust website.
2.Follow the installation instructions to get Rust and Cargo (the Rust package manager) installed on your system and also observe you are using the latest Rust version.
3.Then you ensure you have a Code Editor installed On your system e.g Visual Studio Code(VSCode), Sublime Text, Vim, you can also make use of your terminal on your system or Command Prompt e.t.c.
                                 *Then to Run the Game Code
  
  1.Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game.git
  2.Then you move into the project folder by inputing : cd guessing-game , which means send directory to the name of the file guessing-game.
  3.Lastly you build and run the Project by inputing : cargo run , then Once the program is running, it will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
    Keep guessing until you find the right number!
